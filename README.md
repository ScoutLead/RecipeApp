# Getting started

This is a minimal CRUD service exposing a couple of endpoints over REST.

Under the hood, this demo uses:

- RESTEasy to expose the REST endpoints
- REST-assured and JUnit 5 for endpoint testing

## Requirements

To compile and run this demo you will need:

- JDK 1.8+
- GraalVM

### Configuring GraalVM and JDK 1.8+

Make sure that both the `GRAALVM_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables have
been set, and that a JDK 1.8+ `java` command is on the path.

See the [Building a Native Executable guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image-guide)
for help setting up your environment.

## Building the application

Launch the Maven build on the checked out sources of this demo:

> ./mvnw package

### Live coding

The Maven plugin provides a development mode that supports
live coding. To try this out:

> ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev

This command will leave Quarkus running in the foreground listening on port 8080.

### Run in JVM mode

When you're done iterating in developer mode, you can run the application as a
conventional jar file.

First compile it:

> ./mvnw package

Then run it:

> java -jar ./target/RecipeApp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar

Have a look at how fast it boots, or measure the total native memory consumption.

### Run as a native executable

You can also create a native executable from this application without making any
source code changes. A native executable removes the dependency on the JVM:
everything needed to run the application on the target platform is included in
the executable, allowing the application to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compiling a native executable takes a bit longer, as GraalVM performs additional
steps to remove unnecessary codepaths. Use the  `native` profile to compile a
native executable:

> ./mvnw package -Dnative

After getting a cup of coffee, you'll be able to run this executable directly:

> ./target/RecipeApp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
